## üöÄ Codex Task: Build a Scalable eCommerce UI Kit

Welcome, Codex contributors! This repository is focused on building a **fully responsive, reusable, and accessible eCommerce UI Kit** using modern frontend best practices.

---

### üéØ Objective

The goal is to develop a component-driven UI kit for eCommerce apps with full support for:

* Modular components (e.g. `ProductCard`, `CartItem`, `CheckoutSummary`)
* Dark/Light themes with design tokens
* Internationalization (i18n) and RTL support
* Accessibility compliance (ARIA, keyboard nav, etc.)
* Storybook documentation

This UI kit is intended for both **web** and **mobile-responsive views**, similar to Shopify Polaris or Material UI.
